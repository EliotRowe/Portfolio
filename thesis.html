<h2>Background and Purpose</h2>
<hr>
<div class="row2">
<div class="col2">
	<img src="" style="width: 100%;">
</div>
	<div class="col2">
		<p>
			Manure deposition from livestock grazing poses a signifigant threat to water supplies. This risk limits the number of animals that can graze in a single pasture. The goal of the Greener Pasture Research Project, funded by USDA NIFA and NSF, is to automate the removal of manure from pastures to increase efficiency of livestock agriculture.

<div class="col2">
	<ul >
		<li>To accomplish this, collaborators from CWRU and Virginia Tech retrofitted a John Deere 1025R subcompact tractor to drive autonomously.</li>
		<li>My objective was to develop a manure collection system for the robot that is electrically powered and mounts directly to the bucket of the front end loader attchment.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>
<hr>

<div class="col2">
	<img src="thesis/full_cad.png" style="width: 100%;">
</div>
	<div class="col2">
		<ul>
			<li>Used a rotating cylindrical brush to sweep manure off the ground into the tractor's bucket.</li>
			<li>Manipulator is mounted on the bucket with a hinge at the top of the frame, the angle of the frame is controlled by a linear actuator.</li>
			<li>Brush is mounted to a subframe that is attached to the frame on slides, this subframe is positioned with another linear actuator. </li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row2rev"> 

	<div class="col2">
		<ul>
			<li>Positioning the brush with two active degrees of freedom allows for more flexibility in positioning the robot relative to the collection target.</li>
			<li>The primary collection strategy is start with the brush on the opposite side of the manure pile and to sweep backwards towards the bucket while the brush is spinning.</li>
			<li>Video shows collection sequence in action, collecting cow-like faux manure on concrete.</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="col2">
		<ul>
			<li>Both frames are constructed from extruded aluminum T-slot framing to allow for for easy modifications to the design.</li>
			<li>The Mounting positions for the linear actuator were designed to acheive the desired range of motion and were manufactured using a combination of traditional and CNC techniques.</li>
			<li>All major components are made from corrosion resistant materials, Aluminum, Stainless steel, POM, for outdoor operation.</li>
		</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<hr>
<div class="row2">

<div class="col2">
	<ul>
		<li>The manipulator's performance was tested across three different surfaces: Grass, Straw and Concrete.</li>
		<li>The tests were completed using a mixture of water, potting soil, alfalfa and flour designed to simulate real manure.</li>
		<li>Two different formulae for the faux manure mixture were created: one closer to cow manure and one closer to horse manure.</li>
	</ul>

	<img style="width: 100%;" src="thesis/results_chart.png"></img>
</div>

<div class="col2">
	<ul>
		<li>For each trial, a simulated cow patty was formed by filling a mold with faux manure and place infront of the robot.</li>
		<li>The autonomous collection sequence was ran and the percentage of manure collected was calculated from the initial and final mass of faux manrue.</li>
		<li>On average more than 80% of manure was collected in all trials; on concrete, more than 95% was collected on average.</li>
		<li>More details on the design and analysis of results can be found in my thesis: hosted on <a href="http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=case1749759413153502">OhioLINK</a>.</li>
