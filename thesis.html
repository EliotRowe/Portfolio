		<ul>
			<li>Manure deposition from livestock grazing poses a signifigant threat to water supplies.</li>
			<li>This risk limits the number of animals that can be graze in a single pasture.</li>
			<li>The goal of the Greener Pasture Research Project is to automate the removal of manure from pastures to increase effeciency of livestock agriculture.</li>

	<ul >
		<li>To accomplish this, collaborators retrofitted a John Deere 1025R subcompact tractor to drive autonomously</li>
		<li>My Objective was to develop a manure collection system for the robot that is electrically powered and mounts directly to the bucket of the front end loader attchment</li>

<h2>Design</h2>

<div class="col2">

	<div class="col2">
		<ul>
			<li>My design uses a rotating cylindrical brush to sweep manure into the tractor's bucket off of the ground.</li>
			<li>The manipulator is attached the thre tractor with a hinge at the top of the frame, the angle of the frame is controlled by a linear actuator.</li>
			<li>The brush itself is mounted to a subframe that is attached to the frame on slides, this subframe is positioned with another linear actuator. </li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row2rev"> 

	<div class="col2">
		<ul>
			<li>Positioning the brush with two active degrees of freedom allows for more flexibility in positioning the robot relative to the collection target.</li>
			<li>The primary collection strategy is start with the brush on the opposite side of the manure pile and to sweep backwards towards the bucket while the brush is spinning.</li>
			<li>A test run of the system is shown on the left.</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="col2">
		<ul>
			<li>Both frames are constructed from extruded aluminum T-slot framing to allow for for easy modifications to the design.</li>
			<li>The Mounting positions for the linear actuator were designed to achive the desired range of motion and were manufactured using a combination of traditional and CNC techniques.</li>
			<li>Because the robot operates outdoors, all of the major components are made from corrosion resistant materials: Aluminum, Stainless steel, POM.</li>
		</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<hr>
<div class="row2">

<div class="col2">
	<ul>
		<li>The manipulator's performance was tested across three different surfaces: Grass, Straw and Concrete.</li>
		<li>The tests were complted using a mixture of water, potting soil, alfalfa nad flour designed to emulate real manure.</li>
		<li>Two different formulae for the faux manure mixture were created: one closer to cow manure and one closer to horse manure.</li>
	</ul>

</div>

<div class="col2">
	<ul>
		<li>For each trial, a simulated cow patty was formed by filling a mold with faux manure and place infront of the robot.</li>
		<li>The autonomous collection sequence was ran and the percentage of manure collected was calculated form the initial and final mass of faux manrue.</li>
		<li>On average more than 80% of manure was collected in all trials, on concrete more than 95% was collected on average.</li>
		<li>More details on the design and analysis of results can be found in my thesis: hosted on <a href="http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=case1749759413153502">OhioLINK</a>.</li>
